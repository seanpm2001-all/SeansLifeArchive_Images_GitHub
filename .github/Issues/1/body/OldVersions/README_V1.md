### [Upload error] Data for December 25th 2020 uploaded incorrectly

I made a small error on December 26th 2020 with the December 25th 2020 images. There were no commit count mile stones for this date, and I mixed the data for this directory and the miscellaneous directory.

Miscellaneous images for December 25th 2020 were accidentally uploaded to Commit_Count_Milestones for December 25th 2020. The IGNORE.md file is also not there, there is a README.md file there instead. Make sure to delete it before February 2021.
