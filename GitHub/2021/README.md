# GitHub images from 2021

This is my directory that houses my GitHub images from the year 2021. The tradition of getting screenshots of GitHub progress stemmed from early commit count milestone pictures. As of 2021, it has become a set tradition.

Images are sorted into 5 categories:

* **Commit count milestones** - The one that started it all and is still going. Whenever a unique number of commits is reached (palindrome, power of 100, power of 250, x+255, x+256, or other)

* **End of day** - A slightly newer one, end of day pictures are GitHub progress pictures of different repositories that I worked on that day, and also the profile.

* **Follower and star count** - Started in March 2021, the section where my follower, following, and star count are present, along with organizations, and the top of my profile README. Started March 1st 2021, with some missed days.

* **Miscellaneous** - Originally for other GitHub pictures, but it quickly turned into a compilation of all the other GitHub pictures of the day

* **Upload-fails** - Originally for when an upload failed, but then turned into a place for 500 errors. On March 8th 2021, it was repurposed to include all GitHub errors.

The images are sorted into 3 subcategories:

* 1. **Light mode** - For images in light mode

* 2. **Dark mode** - For images in dark mode

* 3. **Mixed** - For images in both light and dark mode. Called unsorted up until February 28th 2021, turned into mixed on March 1st 2021

Currently, I haven't uploaded the images separately in different visual modes, so only mixed and unsorted are currently maintained.

These images are used for progress monitoring and achievements.

Images from 2021 are in 1920x1200 resolution and are in the PNG format. They were taken on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with the GNOME 3.36.1 Desktop environment.
